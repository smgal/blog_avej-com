#### The Future
The future is here. The future is now. The future is static.
- No more server-side logic
- No more database
- No more backend
- No more complex

```js
    // Sort by Date DESC, then Seq DESC
    return posts.sort((a, b) => {
        if (a.date !== b.date) return b.date.localeCompare(a.date);
        return b.seq.localeCompare(a.seq);
    });
```
